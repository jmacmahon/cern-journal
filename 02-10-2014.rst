- Elasticsearch Python logging library

  - Fridayâ€“Tuesday was spent trying to hack async into the standard Python
    Elasticsearch library.

    - Benchmarking gave speeds of ~1000 requests/second.

    - Broke a lot of functionality as parts of the library expect results,
      status codes etc. to be returned directly.

  - New approach: keep logs in a queue; this is flushed synchronously to ES
    every n seconds or every m events, but in a separate thread.

- Concerns about Python GIL but after some playing it turns out OK.

    - Currently writing up documentation and expanding test coverage.

    - Benchmarking gave speeds of ~2000 requests/second.

    - Working much better.

  - Note on the benchmarking results: using March 2013 as an example month, the
    highest number of requests/second on CDS was ~400.  The 99.99th %-ile was
    99 requests/second.)

- Filed a feature request for Elasticsearch itself; they agreed it would be
  nice to have but closed the bug as a duplicate. (elasticsearch/elasticsearch
  #7703)

- Starting French course on Monday!

- Makis is slowly teaching me Greek too.

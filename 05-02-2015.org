** FOSDEM

- I didn't manage to get to the Elasticsearch talk that I was intending to go
  to, because I think there was a clash and I wanted to see something else.

- However, I did go and chat to the guy on the Elasticsearch stand and got some
  insight into their security model.

- In general, I went to some cool talks about Rust, recommendation engines with
  Neo4j, and NixOS, did lots of networking and some tourism.

** Elasticsearch

*** Nginx configurations

- At the moment, traffic from the worker nodes is going across the network to
  the cluster unencrypted, so:

  - The plan is to use an Nginx front-end on the Elasticsearch nodes, with SSL
    and client-side certificates for authentication.

- For security and access to the cluster by users, we can limit public requests
  to GET only.

  - Would be good to include CERN single sign on rather than HTTP basic auth,
    but this looks like it will take some work with Nginx.

- Nginx is really great -- lightweight and easy to configure.  I love it!

** Lumberjack

- A minor bug was reported by Jean-Yves and Esteban regarding bibsched.  It
  causes an exception to be raised just before bibsched terminates, resulting
  in some ugly text on the terminal.

  - Currently I'm trying to reproduce it outside of an Invenio context.

Bonne ann√©e tout le monde !

CDS
---

- Over new year we had a crash on CDS -- 503 service unavailable for about a
  full day.

- Initial cause was an inconsistency in Elasticsearch (caused by Lumberjack)

  - Then various error conditions applied and caused a secondary crash in
    Lumberjack

- Fortunately, Nikos worked on it remotely for some hours and managed to bring
  the service back online.

Lumberjack
----------

- Patched bad error handling which caused the secondary crash.

- Still working on patching the bad template code -- so far I've been unable to
  reproduce the inconsistency, so it's difficult.

  - This is not urgent, since this particular crash will not happen again until
    01/01/2016.

  - It is nevertheless high-priority as it can affect all newly-created log
    events from Invenio.

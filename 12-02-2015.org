** Nginx/Elasticsearch security

- Finalised configuration for "client" and "server" Nginx front-ends.

  - I had some difficulty setting up client-side SSL certificates, but that's
    now resolved.

- Musings with Nikos re: SSL configuration, Nginx versions, Puppet.

- Benchmarking the new configuration to assess impact of encryption on indexing
  log data.

- I've also been researching alternatives to the Nginx front-end solution.

  - There's a not-yet-released project called Elasticsearch Defender which
    looks very promising.

  - Taking part in a discussion re: Shield/Defender on the ES GitHub page.

** Lumberjack

- I've tracked down the cause of the bibsched bug, but it looks like there's
  something strange happening in the threading library.

  - More investigation needed, but I'm beginning to suspect it's a bug in
    Python threading.

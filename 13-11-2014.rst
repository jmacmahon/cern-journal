First update in a while!

Previous weeks
--------------

- Finished work on "Lumberjack" -- Python library for async logging to
  Elasticsearch.

  - Still not finalised the name.

- Added a patch for master to support logging of downloads and pageviews to
  Elasticsearch, via Lumberjack.  This can go on CDS when our cluster is ready.

- Working on pu, adding code to log custom events using Lumberjack in a
  generalised way.

  - Adding a REST API to get data for views in statistics module.

This week
---------

- We finally have some machines for our cluster! (Yay)

- Nikos has written some puppet files, and I've been going over the machines
  making sure they're set up as expected.

- Doing some more benchmarking to establish query times under different
  configurations.

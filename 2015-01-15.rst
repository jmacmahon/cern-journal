- I did a *lot* of debugging trying to figure out the source of the template
  inconsistency in Elasticsearch.

  - (I ended up having to run tcpdump on all the Elasticsearch nodes to inspect
    the HTTP streams by hand.)

- Rewrote the template management functionality to be more
  sensible.

- Made the fallback mode (write JSON strings to a file) more robust.

- Simplified parts of the test suite.

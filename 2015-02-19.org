** Lumberjack

- Tracked down the cause of the bibsched traceback and patched in a workaround.

  - Caused by a bug in Python threading library
    (http://bugs.python.org/issue14623), but this is a "won't fix" in Python 2.

  - As suspected, it is completely harmless and is a result of some
    inconsistency in the CPython interpreter shutdown.

- Done a little cleaning-up of code in general.

** Nginx/Elasticsearch security

- Fully tested the Nginx configs with Invenio-master and the test ES cluster.
  - Made some minor alterations but should be good to go.

- Finished benchmarking: using the Nginx encrypted tunnel results in throughput
  being reduced from 11.3 MiB/s to 7.41 MiB/s (~35%)

  - Expect the actual max. throughput to be higher on production, however even
    7.41 MiB/s is far more than we need.  (Currently we index data in bursts of
    ~250 kiB every 30s)

** Invenio

- Added some code to check user agents contain bot IDs (e.g. "Googlebot",
  "bingbot") and add a TTL to the event record if necessary.

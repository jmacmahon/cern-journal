- Off work with some flu on Monday & Tuesday

** Authentication for Kibana

- I've been exploring both Apache/Shibboleth and Nginx/OAuth2

- So far both seem really fiddly and complicated -- I will ask for the
  Shibboleth config we use on CDS.

** Visualisations

- Familiarising myself with the statistics visualisations on master

- Started to work again on my elasticsearch_visualisations branch (fork of pu)

  - Learning ChartJS.

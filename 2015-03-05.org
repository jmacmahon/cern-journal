** Nginx
- Tested final configuration with:

  - Invenio -> Lumberjack -> Elasticsearch stack

  - Logstash -> Elasticsearch stack

  - Also tested failure states and graceful recovery

- Ready to deploy with Nikos

** Visualisations (PU)

- Working on making my previous work more generic -- not ES specific, removing register_schema, putting more into a config file.

** Elasticsearch

- Begun testing/benchmarking wrt. JRE versions

  - Aim to compare OpenJDK vs. Oracle and also Java 7 vs. Java 8

  - So far I've been unable to find a good benchmark that produces heavy load
    in circumstances I'd like -- ES is very clever with its optimisation and
    caching.

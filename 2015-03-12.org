** CDS

- Deployed and enabled nginx setup with Nikos (finally).

  - All communication to/from the cluster is encrypted and authenticated now.

** Elasticsearch

- Begun collecting data for benchmarking

  - Experienced a setback due to Puppet reinstalling the "correct" Java without
    me noticing.

  - Moved to the non-puppet-managed cluster and started again.

- Also following the elasticsearch-defender repo on GitHub.

  - Very much not production yet, but still interesting.

** Invenio

- More work on visualisations code

  - Changed format of the statistics config file slightly

  - Working on UI

  - Making front-end more generic

- Renamed local branches and had to do some messy rebasing onto upstream.

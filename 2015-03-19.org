** Visualisations

- Switched back to using Flot, since it has a plugin to deal automatically with
  time-based data series.

- Had some dependency issues with Python, so I had to re-set up my environment a few times.

  - Now created a vagrant snapshot with vanilla Invenio2 installed just to make things easier.

- Started looking at other chart types (pie charts, histograms etc.)

** Elasticsearch benchmarking

- So far unable to find any big difference between the versions of Java tested,
  which makes me thing I need to get better data.

  - Still thinking about how best to do that.

- We had an incident in which cluster node 7 became unresponsive, but after
  musing with Nikos, we think it was a hypervisor issue rather than ES.

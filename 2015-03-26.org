** Elasticsearch

- Deployed new node, cds-statistics-11, which will deal with queries and kibana.

  - Turned cds-statistics-02 back into a standard data node.

- Trying to merge cds-olddata-2014 into cds-2014, but there is a bug in my
  Python script to do this.

  - Fortunately I tagged all the data from cds-olddata-2014 so that when a
    merge goes wrong we can delete by tag from the new index and start again.

  - Will continue to debug and re-merge.

** Visualisations

- Some minor progress, I restructured the config.json again.

** TWiki

- Started filling in the TWiki page for the ES cluster.

- The idea is that it will act as a knowledge base containing software
  versions, setup instructions, sample configurations etc., for anybody
  administering our ES cluster.

- I haven't really done that much due to being on holiday in Berlin last week.

- Catching up on unread email and maintaining git branches

- Some more small progress on visualisations

- I tried to merge the cds-olddata-2014 ES index again, but somehow the bug in
  the script is still there.

- I've been thinking about the best format to present the ES/Logstash lightning
  talk with Nikos.

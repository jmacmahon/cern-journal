================

- Returned from the UK on Tuesday (I had a good time being social and also I
  talked to my academic tutor about some computational linguistics projects).

- I've been having some trouble with the CDS test elasticsearch cluster -- some
  of the smaller machines keep running out of memory and the problem is quite
  hard to track down.

  - Hopefully it's now more-or-less fixed with some config changes, but we'll
    see if the cluster stays stable over the next few days.

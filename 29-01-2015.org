** Invenio

- Implemented logging of downloads and pageviews events in pu.

** CDS

- Lumberjack back on production, after some code reviewing from Nikos.

- If it crashes again I will buy everyone in the office a beer.

- Trying to index remaining chunk of historical downloads and pageviews, but
  I've been having issues with MySQL all week.  It's finally working and
  uploading the remaining pageviews now.

 - After this we need to index the events from when we fell back to MySQL
   logging last week.

** General

- Participated in the second CERN Whitehat Challenge training, practising SQL
  injection etc.

- FOSDEM this weekend!  Among other things they have some talks on
  Elasticsearch internals and the ELK stack so I hope to come back with some
  more knowledge.
